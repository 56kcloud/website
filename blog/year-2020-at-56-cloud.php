This week we officially launched our new website and our designers submitted the new design to the Awwwards! We believe having a strong brand is as important in delivering a strong service to our customers and community, therefore we have invested in allot of time and effort into making a lasting impression. This is not only from a marketing perspective but also to clearly communicate not just in the tech industry but to a wider community. As technology becomes ever more ingrained in our daily lives we need to position ourselves correctly in the minds of the wider scope of businesses that can benefit, be inspire and support them in there cloud journey.</p>
