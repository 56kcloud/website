							<h2>Why we branded 56K.Cloud</h2>

							<p>Initially we didn’t have a logo, I drew up something with a black background that was enough for daily business, having been involved in branding in the past and understanding the value and purpose of it. At the time, we didn’t need a strong public presence. In the early days of 56K, we were sharing an office in a small co-working office "Kontor3" in Winterthur. Two designers became inspired by our work and proposed to brand the company. Jon Galbo and Andy Schenkel presented a short brief, and Brian and I were hooked, so we let them concept up a new logo, business cards, and briefs.</p>

							<p>What we received was inspiring! People liked the logo, colours, typescript, and business cards.  Here are a few shots of that earlier design work.</p>

								We knew a website was in the pipeline, but we also wanted to complete a lot of the strategy work we had done to build a "single message." A message in which new and existing customers could relate. Cloud is a relatively new topic in the broader scope of industries out there. Not everyone is up to speed and needs coaching, and a learning experience to understand the value for their organization and customers. It's an applied effort and not a "Solution in a box". Transforming one's business in the Cloud is a vastly new process. Hence, we are there to guide and support our partners and customers in their Cloud Journey. </p>

								Realising this work, we engaged Julien and Diego from Studio Voila; after they related well to the existing work and presented how they could further inspire our vision. Next, we engaged Studio Voila to build out a few illustrations, extending the colour scheme, fonts, and website layout. After a few months of work and a lot of investment on both sides, we are happy with the results. It presents well a refreshing and dynamic brand that builds on the changing technology we see today in the Cloud! </p>
